### Hello World ! 👋🏽
I'm Ronnie, a Technologist and Artist at the core. I enjoy converting complex problems into Technology, Design and Experiences that are both intuitive and exciting. Over time, I've worked on various projects across a wide range of Technologies, involving software development for Cloud applications, Mobile applications, Computer systems, Computer Graphics. Aside from my daily work, I ocasionally spend time contributing to Open-Source, and working on personal Art projects in line with CGI, Animation, Writing & Film Direction/Production.
