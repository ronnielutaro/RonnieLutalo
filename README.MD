### Hello World ! 👋🏽
I'm Ronnie, a Technologist and Artist at the core. I enjoy turning complex problems into Technology, Design and Experiences that are both intuitive and exciting. 

Aside from my daily work, I spend time doing research in areas of Computer Graphics and Computer Systems, how they can help us live better experiences.

I'm open to talking about Technology and how it can help us live better experiences.
